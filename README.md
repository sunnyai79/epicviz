# EpiRecipes Visualization Application
## Project Overview
The EpiRecipes Visualization Application is a data analytics project focused on cleaning, analyzing, and extracting insights from a dataset of recipes. The project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization, aiming to uncover actionable insights that can improve user experiences on recipe platforms.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the EpiRecipes Dataset sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on over 20,000 recipes, including ingredients, ratings, nutritional values (calories, protein, fat, sodium), and dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, peanut-free). You can find the dataset here.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project include:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze key trends and relationships in the data using various charts and visualizations.
- Insights & Business Questions: Extract insights to answer business-related questions, such as identifying popular ingredients in highly rated recipes and understanding correlations between nutritional content and recipe ratings.
- Video Presentation: A short video walkthrough that explains the findings and visualizations.

## Key Tasks
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    - Identified missing values in columns like calories, protein, fat, and sodium and imputed missing data with median values.
    - Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
    - Handled outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to minimize their influence on the analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Generated visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships between variables like nutritional values and recipe ratings.
    - Investigated common ingredients in highly rated recipes and examined the impact of dietary preferences and preparation time on recipe ratings.
- Insights
    - Common Ingredients: Identified that ingredients like 'corn', 'tomatoes', and 'apple' are common in highly rated recipes.
    - Preparation Time: Found that quick and easy recipes are often rated higher, highlighting the importance of convenience.
    - Nutritional Content: Discovered that there is no strong linear relationship between recipe ratings and nutritional values such as calories or protein, suggesting that other factors (e.g., taste, complexity) may drive user preferences.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: For data analysis and visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Jupyter Notebooks: For documenting the analysis and visualizations.
- Video Presentation: A brief 3-5 minute video explaining the insights and visualizations.
